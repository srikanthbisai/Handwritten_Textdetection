This Repository contains code of Real-Time Handwritten Text Detection Using CRNN a hybrid model consisting of CNN + Bidirectional LSTM + CTC layer.

Install the required packages (os, numpy, pandas, random, string, , tensorflow, keras , matplotlib, groupby) through pip. Install handwritten dataset from kaggle and unzip the archive folder. Place the dataset and handwritten_TextDetection.ipynb in the same folder. Replace the path of the training dataset and testing dataset with the respective relative path of your dataset.

Train the model. And test the model on your custom images.

Download Pytesseract library from tesseract docs and set the TESS DATA File in your environment variable. By connecting a webcam you can detect handwritten text in realtime.
